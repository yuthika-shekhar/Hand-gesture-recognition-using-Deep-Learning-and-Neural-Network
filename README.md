## Hand-gesture-recognition-using-Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network

The process of identifying meaningful expressions of form and motion made solely by the hands of a human being is known as hand gesture recognition. Hand gesture recognition has a wide range of uses, including enhancing control, accessibility, communication, and learning. In the research reported in this publication, we experimented with many convolutional neural network types, including my own unique model.I have used Deep Learning models like Conv2D and conv3D in order to identify the hand gestures. The final model with Conv3D produced accuracy of 94.57\% and validation accuracy was 91.00\% which is comparatively good enough accuracy to identify the hand gestures.
